**During Product Development, the product is built and tested. As a Product Manager, you're not actually the one building the productâ€”that's what your team will be working on. Instead, your role is to make sure that the right product gets built at the right time. This course will focus on what happens during product development, the role that a product manager plays in key activities, as well as soft skills that will help to make you more effective.**
