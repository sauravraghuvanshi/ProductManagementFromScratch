## Things to Remember
**“A Design Sprint is a time-constrained process that uses design thinking with the aim of reducing the risk when bringing a new product, service or a feature to the market.” -- Wikipedia(opens in a new tab)**

Using a Design Sprint
- Allows the team to explore and learn without actually building
- This means the process can fail early without serious consequences
- Creates buy-in and ownership among the team

The Design Sprint process is highly customizable and can be adapted to the specifics of each challenge.
